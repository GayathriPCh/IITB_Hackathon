# AeroToken ( Flight Ticketing Decentralized Application on XRPL )

Project is deployed on https://iitb-hackathon-timl.vercel.app/

## Steps to download and use XRPL using Xaman wallet
1) Go to playstore and download Xaman
2) Open app and create account and copy the public address while creating ( if lost then got to settings -> accounts there you will find the "public address/wallet address"
3) now switch to developer mode by going to settings -> Advanced -> Network settings. Here first in Advanced we have to enable developer mode and then go to the Network setting to change to XRPL Testnet
4) While signing in with wallet to connect wallet to a dapp, we need to scan a qr using the middle black button in this application to scan.
5) if you still see the activate account error then check on the top right if the network is "XRP ledger" or "XRPL Testnet" , then change it to "XRPL Testnet".
